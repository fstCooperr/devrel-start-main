# How did I create my first project on GitHub?

**Starting out, I understood nothing.**
When I first opened GitHub and VS Code, everything seemed complicated and confusing — buttons, commands, branches, errors. But step by step, even through failures, I began to figure things out. Every new commit, every attempt to set up a project taught me that it’s not important to know everything at once — what matters is moving forward gradually. I realized the main thing is not to be afraid to try and to fix mistakes.

Creating my first project became an important moment for me. That’s when I felt that I could grow in this field, even if I knew nothing in the beginning.

**Everything you do makes you better!**
And this small path is only the beginning of a much bigger journey ahead.
