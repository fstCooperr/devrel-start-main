# What is DevRel?

**DevRel (Developer Relations)** is a role that helps developers successfully use a product: API, SDK, library, or platform.
DevRel operates at the intersection of product and community and focuses on three things:

1. **Helping developers get started**
- Quickstart guides (quick start), simple examples and templates to help users get results as quickly as possible.

2. **Listen and provide feedback**
- Collect questions, bugs, and suggestions from developers and pass them on to the product team to improve the product.

3. **Build and maintain a community**
- Write articles, record videos, conduct workshops, modernize Slack/Discord, and help people learn from each other

### DevRel's Main Topics and Tasks
- **Quickstart / Tutorials** - Get started in 5-10 minutes.
- **SDK / CLI / Examples** - Ready-made code in popular languages.
- **Community & Events** - Meetups, workshops, hackathons.
- **Analystic & Metrics** - How many people achieved the result, which steps are broken.
- **Support & Issue Triage** - Answer questions and help with mistakes.
- **Product feedback loop** - Influence the roadmap through insights from developers.

### Why is this important?
DevRel accelerates product adoption, lowers the barrier to entry, and helps build a community of developers who will recommend and further develop the product.
