# My first Quickstart: why it works this way

## Starting point
At the beginning, I had very little experience with DevRel
and API documentation. Even running simple examples felt confusing,
especially when tools like Node.js or Live Server were involved.
## What I wanted to achieve
The goal of this Quickstart was to help a beginner
run a working example in just a few minutes,
without needing to understand the entire project first.
## Key decisions
I intentionally kept the Quickstart minimal.
It uses only one file, one API request,
and avoids unnecessary setup steps.

This reduces cognitive load and helps users
focus on the result instead of configuration.
## What worked well
Clear step-by-step instructions worked well.
Each step had a visible result,
which increased confidence and motivation.
## What I would improve next
In the future, I would add screenshots
and a short troubleshooting section,
since beginners often get stuck on environment issues.
## Conclusion
This Quickstart showed me that good DevRel
is not about complex code,
but about empathy and clarity.
