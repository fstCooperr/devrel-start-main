## My First Month Learning DevRel from Scratch

When I started this journey, I didn’t understand anything about DevRel.
APIs, documentation, GitHub workflows, CORS errors — all of it felt overwhelming. At the beginning, I honestly thought that I wouldn’t be able to finish this path at all.

Starting was not easy, but I managed to push through.
Every day I woke up early and spent time learning DevRel, even when things were confusing and frustrating. Progress felt slow at first, and many days nothing worked the way I expected. But I kept going.

One of the hardest parts was realizing how much is usually assumed in developer documentation. Many examples are written for people who already “know the basics.” As a beginner, I constantly ran into errors without understanding why they happened. Simple things like running an HTML file, using Live Server, or making a fetch request caused issues that were not explained anywhere.

Through this process, I learned that DevRel is not primarily about writing complex code. It is about empathy. It is about understanding what a beginner sees, where they get stuck, and why they feel lost. Clear README files, good quickstarts, and honest explanations of common mistakes matter more than fancy implementations.

During this month, I built a small but complete beginner-friendly project. I created simple API examples that run in the browser, wrote step-by-step instructions, documented common errors, and structured everything so a newcomer could succeed in a few minutes. I also created a workshop-style guide and a short mini-talk to explain my learning process and design decisions.

What surprised me most was how powerful documentation can be. Writing down problems I personally faced — CORS issues, incorrect API URLs, browser limitations — helped me understand that these are not “stupid mistakes.” They are natural learning steps. A good DevRel experience does not hide these problems but explains them clearly.

At the start, I truly thought this wouldn’t work out. I doubted myself more than once. But as you can see, I finished it. This journey taught me that consistency matters more than confidence. Showing up every day, even for a short time, makes a real difference.

This project is not perfect, but it represents real progress. More importantly, it represents a mindset shift: from trying to understand everything at once to focusing on helping the next beginner feel less lost than I did.
