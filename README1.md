# DevRel Start

Learning DevRel step by step from zero.

## About
This repository documents my journey into DevRel.
Starting with GitHub, API basics, and demos.

## What I learned
- Git & GitHub basics
- Pull Requests
- API fundamentals
- Working demos

## Why is this really DevRel, and not just "pretty"?

DevRel README:
- explains what it is
- explains why
- shows the result
- beginner-friendly

❌ Bad:
> "Here's the code, you'll figure it out"

✅ Good:
> "Here's the goal, here's an example, here's how to try it"


## 🔹 End-of-day checklist

Before committing:
```
- ✅ There are headings
- ✅ There are lists
- ✅ There is a code block
- ✅ The README reads like a story
- ✅ Clear for a beginner
```
## Demo
Simple API demo using fetch:
```js
fetch("https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2")
